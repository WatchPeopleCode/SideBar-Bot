# WPC-stream-bot
A bot for WPC to get the "top 3 streams" (currently these streams are chosen at random) and place them in the sidebar.

# Configuration
The bot is configured from a single ```config.json``` file, an example can be found in ```example_config.json```. It allows you to things like specify which data to pull mode, what reddit account to use and how to format the description.

# Running
Once you have filled out the ```config.json``` with a valid reddit account with moderator access to the wanted subreddit, you can safely execute the bot with ```python3 bot.py```.
